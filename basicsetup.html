            <h2 id="introduction-ide">Introduction to IDEs</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) serves as a comprehensive software suite designed to
                    streamline and facilitate the software development process.</li>
                <li>It functions as a centralized platform, offering a range of tools and features to assist developers
                    in coding, debugging, and deploying applications.</li>
                <li>The primary goal of an IDE is to enhance efficiency by providing an all-in-one solution that
                    combines code editing, debugging, and project management within a unified interface.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>An IDE typically includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Code Editor:</strong> Enables developers to write, edit, and manage code efficiently with
                    features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion.</li>
                <li><strong>Debugger:</strong> Facilitates the identification and resolution of bugs and errors within
                    the code, ensuring optimal performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Compiler/Interpreter:</strong> Converts human-readable code into machine-executable
                    instructions, allowing for code execution and testing.</li>
                <li><strong>Build Automation Tools:</strong> Streamline the process of compiling source code into
                    executable files or libraries.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Organizes and manages project files, facilitating collaboration
                    and version control.</li>
                <li><strong>User Interface (UI):</strong> Provides an intuitive interface for seamless navigation and
                    accessibility to various features.</li>
            </ul>

            <img src="images/IDE.png" width="100%" alt="Visual Studio Code">
            <p>Understanding the significance of an IDE in the development workflow is crucial for establishing a
                productive and organized coding environment. Whether you're a novice or an experienced developer,
                choosing the right IDE tailored to your programming language and preferences significantly contributes
                to a smoother development experience.</p>

            <h2 id="system-requirements">System Requirements</h2>
            <p>Minimum system requirements for most Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) typically include:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Processor (CPU):</strong> A multi-core processor (e.g., dual-core or quad-core) with a clock
                    speed of 2 GHz or higher is generally recommended for optimal performance.</li>
                <li><strong>RAM (Memory):</strong> At least 4 GB of RAM is a common minimum requirement. However, for
                    more resource-intensive development tasks, 8 GB or more may be recommended.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage:</strong> IDEs usually require several gigabytes of free storage space. A minimum of
                    10 GB of available hard disk space is a common requirement. Solid State Drives (SSDs) can
                    significantly improve performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Most modern IDEs support multiple operating systems, including
                    Windows, macOS, and Linux. Ensure that your operating system is within the supported versions
                    specified by the IDE.</li>
                <li><strong>Graphics:</strong> A basic graphics card with support for a screen resolution of 1280x800 or
                    higher is typically sufficient. Graphics performance is not usually a critical factor for IDEs.</li>
                <li><strong>Java Runtime Environment (JRE):</strong> Many IDEs, especially those written in Java,
                    require a compatible version of the Java Runtime Environment. Make sure to install the recommended
                    JRE version.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If the minimum system requirements for an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) are not met, users may
                experience the following issues:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sluggish Performance:</strong> The IDE may run slowly and respond sluggishly, leading to a
                    less-than-optimal coding experience. Actions like code editing, compilation, and debugging may be
                    delayed.</li>
                <li><strong>Freezing or Crashing:</strong> Insufficient system resources can cause the IDE to freeze or
                    crash unexpectedly. This can result in loss of unsaved work and disrupt the development workflow.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Limited Functionality:</strong> Some features of the IDE may be disabled or exhibit reduced
                    functionality if the system lacks the necessary resources. Certain resource-intensive tools or
                    plugins may not work correctly.</li>
                <li><strong>Compilation Errors:</strong> Compiling code may fail or produce errors if the system lacks
                    the required processing power and memory. This can impede the development and testing process.</li>
                <li><strong>Unresponsiveness:</strong> Users may experience unresponsiveness when interacting with the
                    IDE, such as delayed mouse clicks, unresponsive menus, or slow scrolling. This can hinder the
                    overall usability of the development environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Compatibility Issues:</strong> Incompatibility with specific operating system versions or
                    hardware configurations may arise, preventing the IDE from running altogether.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To avoid these issues, it is crucial to adhere to the recommended system requirements outlined by the
                IDE's documentation. Users should ensure that their hardware and software configurations meet or exceed
                the specified minimums to guarantee a smooth and efficient development experience. Additionally, keeping
                the system and IDE updated with the latest patches and versions can help address compatibility issues
                and improve overall performance.</p>
