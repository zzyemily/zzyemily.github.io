    <h1 id="intro-to-programming">Intro To Programming</h1>
    <p><b>Programming</b> is the art of instructing computers through specialized languages to perform specific tasks. It involves breaking down complex problems into manageable steps and conveying these instructions to the computer in a precise and structured manner. In essence, it is akin to communicating with a highly intelligent machine by utilizing a set of codes designed for that purpose. Programming languages serve as the means to interact with computers effectively. Whether it's crafting intricate software, developing games, or automating routine processes, programming empowers individuals to harness the capabilities of computers, making it an essential skill in the digital age.</p>
    <h1>Programming languages</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Python:</strong>  Python: Python is the most beginner friendly programming language of all. The creators of Python describes it as "written for office workers, students, administrators, and anyone who uses a computer to learn how to code small, practical programs to automate tasks on their computer."</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Best for: data analysis, data scraping, automated programs, software development.</li>
                    <li>Key words: beginner-friendly, practical, automation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <!-- Repeat the structure for other programming languages -->
            <li>
                <p><strong>JavaScript (JS):</strong> If you are a webpage developer or UI designer, then JavaScript is here for you! JavaScript is mostly used to create the programs of a website’s backend (codes that run the page) a long with HTML that controls the frontend (codes that presents the appearance of the page).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Best for: Website backend.</li>
                    <li>Key words: web development, backend.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Java:</strong> This is different than JavaScript!! If you want to start your career设计一个website的图片！as a programmer today, then Java is a great way to begin! It is the most common language and something you must know if you want to enter the computer science industry.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Best for: developing large software, cloud development, scientific purposes.</li>
                    <li>Key words: professional, programming career.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Ruby:</strong> Another option to consider if you are a pure beginner will be Ruby. It is easy to read & write if you understand the English Language. The language itself is also very suitable for practical uses if you want to quickly start using it within work to increase efficiency.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Best for: small websites & apps, data processing.</li>
                    <li>Key words: beginner-friendly, flexible, practical, similar to Python.</li>
                </ul>
